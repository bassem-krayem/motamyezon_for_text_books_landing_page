    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Motamyezon for Text Books was inspired by the dedicated volunteer team at Motamyezon, who spend their time
            converting books into accessible formats for blind readers. Their work transforms PDF files into EPUB, KFX,
            and AZW3 formats, making reading accessible for everyone in the community. Books are organized by
            categories, making it easy for users to find topics that interest them.</p>
        <p>Having read many books from their library, I wanted to give back by providing this free website to support
            their work and make it easier than publishing on Telegram.</p>
